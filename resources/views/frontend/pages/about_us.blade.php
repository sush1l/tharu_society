                <h4 class="mt-1">CORE VALUES</h4>
                <h6 class="mx-3">READ Career Centre here after (READCC) believes in its own core values, outlined below :-
                </h6>
                <p class="mx-5"><b>Research (R)-</b> Research is an investigation or experimentation that is aimed at a discovery and
                    interpretation of facts, revision of theories or laws or practical application of the new or revised
                    theories or laws.<br>
                    <b>Educating people (E)-</b> Education in its general sense is a form of learning in which the knowledge,
                    skills, and habits of a group of people are transferred from one generation to the next through
                    teaching, training, or research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of others.<br>
                    <b>Aspiration (A)-</b> a hope or ambition of achieving something. If your aspiration, or ambition, is to climb
                    Mt. Everest someday, you better start training, because it’s a long, hard climb that requires a lot of
                    preparation.<br>
                   <b> Dignity (D)-</b> the state or quality of being worthy of honor or respect. If someone has dignity, it means
                    they are worthy of respect. If you really want the lead role in a play and you try to bribe the director
                    to give it to you, she might say, “Have you no dignity?” .<br>
                    <b>Competitiveness (C)-</b> as good as or better than others of a comparable nature. If you're competitive, you
                    want to be the best. No one likes to lose, but if you are a competitive person, it will be especially
                    disappointing to see someone else win.<br>
                    <b>Change and dynamics (C)-</b> make or become different. The word dynamics refers to the movement of objects
                    and the forces that drive that movement.<br>

                    Besides these core values we believe in gender equality and inclusiveness from all levels and corners of
                    the society.
